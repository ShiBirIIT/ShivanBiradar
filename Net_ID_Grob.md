  The inverse problem arises from the need to interpret indirect and incomplete measurements. In an inverse problem, an unknown system is subjected to a known input, and the responses are measured. From the limited knowledge of the input, limited knowledge of the system and responses, the aim is to reconstruct the unknown system. This method of inverse analysis also applies to complex electrical networks. The solution of the inverse problems in electric circuits is the circuit topology, values of circuit elements, and time- dependent variations of sources required to achieve a specified circuit behaviour<br><br>

The inverse problems concerning electric circuits are not well studied as in the case of inverse problems in medical imaging, geology and astronomy.
There exist few graph theoretic methods (for inverse problems in electric circuits) for specific circuit topologies like the circular planar circuits, medial
graphs like structured circuit. Therefore, first and foremost challenge is to justify whether it is even possible to extract the solution (circuit topology,
parameter values, etc.) using the obtained responses/measurements through a mapping function (algorithm)?. There are no known universal
strategy/methods for calculating such maps since mapping function differs from topology to topology. <br>
The first proposed goal would be:<br>
1. An efficient "generalised" graph-theoretic method for inverse problems in electric circuits will be developed. This novel graph theoretic method will result in a set of feasible solutions.<br><br>
As a first step towards this we goal we propose a method, which is explaned below.<br><br>

Any graph, directed or undirected, their characteristics are well defined by a matrix (like incidence matrix, adjacency matrix, etc.). Also, corresponding to a graph, various distance metrics are defined like the Kirchhoff‚Äôs distance, the Hamming distance, the Jaccard distance and many more. These metrics essentially characterise the structural properties like criticality of a graph and betweenness of nodes or edges. We propose to use one of the distance metrics i.e. resistance distance. Which is defined as:<br><br>
