  INVERSE PROBLEMS.

  The inverse problem arises from the need to interpret indirect and incomplete measurements. In an inverse problem, an unknown system is subjected to a known input, and the responses are measured. From the limited knowledge of the input, limited knowledge of the system and responses, the aim is to reconstruct the unknown system. This method of inverse analysis also applies to complex electrical networks. The solution of the inverse problems in electric circuits is the circuit topology, values of circuit elements, and time- dependent variations of sources required to achieve a specified circuit behaviour.
