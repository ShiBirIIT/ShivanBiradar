# Network Topology Reconstruction of Circular Planar Electrical Network Kalmanson criteria
# INTRODUCTION
Electrical network topology reconstruction is an ill-posed
problem and, in general, has many solutions. Network topol-
ogy reconstruction involves simultaneously identifying elec-
trical network structure and edge resistor values. This area of
research has seen significant interest among researchers due
to its applications in a wide range of areas, such as system
biology [1], geology [2], medical imaging [3], and power
system networks [4]. Two primary objectives that are broadly
considered in electrical network topology reconstruction are:
i) to determine the conductivity distribution of the electrical
network using the measurements of voltages and current at
the boundary nodes and ii) to find the conductance of each
edge in the electrical network [5].
