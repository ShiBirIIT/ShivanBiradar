    "- [What is Pointwise convergence](https://mathcs.org/analysis/reals/funseq/pconv.html): A sequence of functions $\\{f_n(x)\\}$ with domain $D$ converges pointwise if for each fixed $x_0 \\in D$ in the domain the numeric sequence $\\{  f_n(x_0) \\}$ converges. In other words, for each fixed $x_0$ and any given $\\epsilon>0$ there exist a positive integer $N$ such that:\n",
    "$ |f_n(x_0)-L|<\\epsilon $ wherever $ n\\geq N $ for some limit $L$. Note that limit $L$ dependes on $x_0$. While integer $N$ depends on $x_0$ and $\\epsilon$.<br>\n",

    "OTHER DEFINITION <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let X be a set, and let F be the  real or complex numbers. Consider a sequence of functions f_n where $f_n : X \\to F$ is  bounded function for each $n \\in N$. $f : X \\to F$ is the pointwise limit of $f_n$ if for every $x \\in X$\n",

    "- What is Topology: A topology on nonempty set X is a collection of subsets of X, called \"open set\", such that:\n",
    "1) X and Null set are \"open\".<br>\n",
    "2) The \"union\" of arbitrary colection of open set is \"open\".<br>\n",
    "3) The \"intersction\" of a finite no. of open set is \"open\".<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "More formally, a collection $\\tau$ of subset of X is topology on X if:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "a) Null set and X belongs to $\\tau$.<br>\n",
    "b) if $G_i \\in \\tau$ for $i \\in I$ then $\\cup G_i \\in tau$.<br>\n",
    "c) for any $G_1$ and $G_2$ in $\\tau$, then, $G_1 \\cap G_2 \\in \\tau$.<br>\n",
    "We call the pair(X,$\\tau$) a topological space.\n",

    "For examples look at the [link](https://www.math.uci.edu/~mfinkels/140T/chapter9.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now define, the topology of Pointwise convergence: Let X be any set and Y be any topological space and let f_n : X -> Y, n belongs to N (set of natural numbers), be a sequence of maps. We say that the sequence {f_n} is pointwise convergent, if for every point x in X, the sequence f_n (x) in Y is convergent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compact Set: In mathematics, specifically general topology, compactness is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of Euclidean space being closed (containing all its limit points) and bounded (having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other). Examples of compact spaces include a closed real interval, a union of a finite number of closed intervals, a rectangle, or a finite set of points. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![compact_set](assets/img/compact_set.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compact Support: A function has compact support if it is zero outside of a compact set. Alternatively, one can say that a function has compact support if its support is a compact set. For example, the function $f:x->x^2$ in its entire domain (i.e., $f:R->R^+$) does not have compact support, while any bump function does have compact support. \n",
    " ( the support of a real-valued function $f$ is the subset of the domain containing the elements which are not mapped to zero. )\n",

    "- Infinite dimensional vector space: Not every vector space is given by the span of a finite number of vectors, such a vector space is said to be of infinite dimension or infinite dimensional. e.g. the vector space of all polynomials in $x$ with rational coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Field:  A field is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers do. A field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure which is widely used in algebra, number theory, and many other areas of mathematics.\n",
    "The best known fields are the field of rational numbers, the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers.\n",

    "![field](assets/img/field_def.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstract Algebra: In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algebraic structure: An algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A of finite arity (typically binary operations), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Example of an Algebraic Structure is:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ring_algebra_struct](assets/img/ring_algebra_struct.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. For instance, a vector space involves a second structure called a field, and an operation called scalar multiplication between elements of the field (called scalars), and elements of the vector space (called vectors). In the context of universal algebra, the set A with this structure is called an algebra,[1] while, in other contexts, it is (somewhat ambiguously) called an algebraic structure, the term algebra being reserved for specific algebraic structures that are vector spaces over a field or modules over a commutative ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ring: In mathematics, rings are algebraic structures that generalize fields: multiplication need not be commutative and multiplicative inverses need not exist. In other words, a ring is a set equipped with two binary operations satisfying properties analogous to those of addition and multiplication of integers. Ring elements may be numbers such as integers or complex numbers, but they may also be non-numerical objects such as polynomials, square matrices, functions, and power series.\n",

    "- Module:  A module is one of the fundamental algebraic structures used in abstract algebra. A module over a ring is a generalization of the notion of vector space over a field, wherein scalars are elements of a given ring, and an operation called scalar multiplication is defined between elements of the ring and elements of the module. A module taking its scalars from a ring R is called an R-module.\n",
