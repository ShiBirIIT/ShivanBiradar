**Real Time Forecasting of an Epidemic Using Discrete Time Stochastic Model: A Case Study of Pandemic Covid-19**

This work recognises the stochastic nature of the epidemic dynamics and uses the concepts of well established stochastic models like Reed-Frost model and Greenwood Model, to predict the epidemiological trend of the prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019. 
The Algorithm is based on a premise that a person in susceptible population can either be infected or escapes the infection with certain probability when he comes in adequate contact with an infective. This process creates a chain of infection in population. The
Algorithm-2 models this chain of infection as a binomial process, and estimates the probabilities, which can be further used to predict incidence of COVID-19.
