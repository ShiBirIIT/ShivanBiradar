# CAUCHY INTERLACING THEOREM
The Cauchy interlace theorem states that the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix **A** of order **n** are interlaced with those of any
principal submatrix of order m, m<n.

**Theorem 1 (Cauchy's Interlacing Theorem):** Suppose A ∈ R<sup>n×n</sup>
is symmetric. Let B∈R<sup>m×m</sup> with **m < n** be a principal submatrix (obtained by deleting both i-th
row and i-th column for some values of i). Suppose A has eigenvalues **λ<sub>1</sub> ≤ · · · ≤ λ<sub>n</sub>**
and **B has eigenvalues β<sub>1</sub> ≤ · · · ≤ β<sub>m</sub>**. Then

λ<sub>k</sub> ≤ β<sub>k</sub> ≤ λ<sub>k+n−m</sub> for k = 1, · · · , m
</p>
 And if m = n − 1,
<p align="center">
λ<sub>1</sub> ≤ β<sub>1</sub> ≤ λ<sub>2</sub> ≤ β<sub>2</sub> ≤ · · · ≤ β<sub>n-1</sub> ≤ λ<sub>n</sub>.
</p>
Since all the boundary terminals are not available for the measurements, leading to partially available resistance distances. We  have with us only 
the submatrix of R<sub>D</sub>. 

The eigen value of the submatrix of R<sub>D</sub>, gave us the idea of the eigen values of the original matrix R<sub>D</sub>. These inequalities on the eigen values of the symmetric resistance distance matrix R<sub>D</sub> will be used as constraints.
